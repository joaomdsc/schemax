        This tutorial demonstrates the basics of using Inkscape. If you have opened it from the Inkscape
        <guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu, it is a regular Inkscape document that you can view, edit, or copy from. You can
        also save a copy to a location of your choice.
      </para>
      <para>
        The Basic Tutorial covers canvas navigation, managing documents, shape tool basics, selection techniques,
        transforming objects with selector, grouping, setting fill and stroke, alignment, and stacking order. For more
        advanced topics, check out the other tutorials in the <guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu.

      <title>Panning the canvas</title>
      <para>
        There are many ways to pan (scroll) the document canvas. Try
        <keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>arrow</keycap></keycombo> keys to scroll by keyboard.
        (Try this now to scroll this document down.) You can also drag the canvas by the middle mouse button. Or, you
        can use the scrollbars (press <keycombo><keycap function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>B</keycap></keycombo> to
        show or hide them). The <mousebutton role="mouse-wheel">wheel</mousebutton> on your mouse also works for
        scrolling vertically; press <keycap
function="shift">Shift</keycap> and move the wheel to scroll horizontally.
      </para>

    <sect1>
      <title>Zooming in or out</title>
      <para>
        The easiest way to zoom is by pressing <keycap>-</keycap> and <keycap>+</keycap> (or <keycap>=</keycap>) keys.
        You can also use <keycombo><keycap function="control">Ctrl</keycap><mousebutton
role="middle-click">middle
        click</mousebutton></keycombo> or
        <keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><mousebutton role="right-click">right
        click</mousebutton></keycombo> to zoom in,
        <keycombo><keycap
function="shift">Shift</keycap><mousebutton role="middle-click">middle
        click</mousebutton></keycombo> or
        <keycombo><keycap
function="shift">Shift</keycap><mousebutton role="right-click">right
        click</mousebutton></keycombo> to zoom out, or rotate the mouse
        <mousebutton
role="mouse-wheel">wheel</mousebutton> with <keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap>. Or, you can
        click in the zoom entry field (in the bottom right region of the document window, labelled “Z”), type a
        precise zoom value in %, and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>. We also have the Zoom tool (in the toolbar on left)
        which lets you to zoom into an area by dragging around it.
      </para>
      <para>
        Inkscape also keeps a history of the zoom levels you've used in this work session. Press the <keycap>`</keycap>
        key to go back to the previous zoom, or
        <keycombo><keycap function="shift">Shift</keycap><keycap>`</keycap></keycombo> to go forward.

      <title>Inkscape tools</title>
      <para>
        The vertical toolbar on the left shows Inkscape's drawing and editing tools. Depending on your screen
        resolution, the <firstterm>Commands bar</firstterm> with general command buttons, such as “Save” and
        “Print”, can be found either in the top part of the window, right below the menu, or on the right side of
        the window, in between the scroll bar and the <firstterm>Snap Controls bar</firstterm>. Right above the white
        <firstterm>Canvas Area</firstterm>, there's the <firstterm>Tool Controls bar</firstterm> with controls that are
        specific to each tool. The <firstterm>status bar</firstterm> at the bottom of the window will display useful
        hints and messages as you work.
      </para>
      <para>
        Many operations are available through keyboard shortcuts. Open
        <menuchoice><guimenu>Help</guimenu><guimenuitem>Keys and Mouse Reference</guimenuitem></menuchoice> to see the
        complete list of available shortcuts.

      <title>Creating and managing documents</title>
      <para>
        To create a new empty document, use
        <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>New</guimenuitem></menuchoice> or press
        <keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>N</keycap></keycombo>. To create a new document from
        one of Inkscape's many templates, use <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>New from
        Template…</guimenuitem></menuchoice> or press
        <keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap
function="alt">Alt</keycap><keycap>N</keycap></keycombo>.
      </para>
      <para>
        To open an existing SVG document, use
        <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Open</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
        (<keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>O</keycap></keycombo>). To save, use
        <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
        (<keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>S</keycap></keycombo>), or

        (<keycombo><keycap
function="shift">Shift</keycap><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>S</keycap></keycombo>)
        to save under a new name. (While Inkscape comes with its Autosave feature enabled, it is still recommended that
        you follow the best practice to “save early, save often“.)
      </para>
      <para>
        Inkscape uses the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format for its files. SVG is an open standard widely supported
        by graphic software. SVG files are based on XML and can be edited with any text or XML editor (apart from
        Inkscape, that is). Besides SVG, Inkscape can import and export many other file formats. You can find lists of
        the supported file formats in the <guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem> and <guimenuitem>Import</guimenuitem> dialogs.
      </para>
      <para>
        Inkscape opens a separate document window for each document. You can navigate among them using your window
        manager (e.g. by <keycombo><keycap
function="alt">Alt</keycap><keycap>Tab</keycap></keycombo>), or you can use
        the Inkscape shortcut, <keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Tab</keycap></keycombo>, which
        will cycle through all open document windows. (Create a new document now and switch between it and this document
        for practice.) Note: Inkscape treats these windows like tabs in a web browser, this means the
        <keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Tab</keycap></keycombo> shortcut only works with
        documents running in the same process. If you open multiple files from a file browser or launch more than one
        Inkscape process from an icon it will not work.

      <title>Creating shapes</title>
      <para>
        Time for some nice shapes! Click on the Rectangle tool in the toolbar on the left (or press <keycap>F4</keycap>)
        and click-and-drag, either in a new empty document or right here:
      </para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>
      <para>
        As you can see, default rectangles come up with a blue <firstterm>fill</firstterm> and a black
        <firstterm>stroke</firstterm> (outline), and fully opaque. We'll see how to change that below. With other tools,
        you can also create ellipses, stars, and spirals:
      </para>
      <informalfigure>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="basic-f02.svg"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>
      <para>
        These tools are collectively known as <firstterm>shape tools</firstterm>. Each shape you create displays one or
        more <firstterm>handles</firstterm>; try dragging them to see how the shape responds. The Tool Controls bar for
        a shape tool is another way to tweak a shape; these controls affect the currently selected shapes (i.e. those
        that display the handles) <emphasis>and</emphasis> set the default that will apply to newly created shapes.
      </para>
      <para>
        To <firstterm>undo</firstterm> your last action, press
        <keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Z</keycap></keycombo>. (Or, if you change your mind
        again, you can <firstterm>redo</firstterm> the undone action by
        <keycombo><keycap function="shift">Shift</keycap><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Z</keycap></keycombo>.)

    <sect1>
      <title>Moving, scaling, rotating</title>
      <para>
        The most frequently used Inkscape tool is the <firstterm>Selector</firstterm>. Click the topmost button (with
        the arrow) on the toolbar, or press <keycap>s</keycap>, <keycap>F1</keycap> or toggle the tool using
        <keycap>Space</keycap>. Now you can select any object on the canvas. Click on the rectangle below.
      </para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>
      <para>
        You will see eight arrow-shaped handles appear around the object. Now you can:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <firstterm>Move</firstterm> the object by dragging it. (Press <keycap
  function="control">Ctrl</keycap> to
            restrict movement to horizontal and vertical.)
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <firstterm>Scale</firstterm> the object by dragging any handle. (Press
            <keycap function="control">Ctrl</keycap> to preserve the original height/width ratio.)
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
        Now click the rectangle again. The handles change. Now you can:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <firstterm>Rotate</firstterm> the object by dragging the corner handles. (Press
            <keycap function="control">Ctrl</keycap> to restrict rotation to 15 degree steps. Drag the cross mark to
            position the center of rotation.)
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <firstterm>Skew</firstterm> (shear) the object by dragging non-corner handles. (Press
            <keycap function="control">Ctrl</keycap> to restrict skewing to 15 degree steps.)
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
        While using the Selector, you can also use the numeric entry fields in the Tool Controls bar (above the canvas)
        to set exact values for coordinates (X and Y) and size (W and H) of the selection.

    <sect1>
      <title>Transforming by keys</title>
      <para>
        One of the features that set Inkscape apart from most other vector editors is its emphasis on keyboard
        accessibility. There's hardly any command or action that is impossible to do from keyboard, and transforming
        objects is no exception.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can use the keyboard to move (<keycap>arrow</keycap> keys), scale (<keycap>&lt;</keycap> and
        <keycap>&gt;</keycap> keys), and rotate (<keycap>[</keycap> and <keycap>]</keycap> keys) objects. Default moves
        and scales are by 2 px; with <keycap function="shift">Shift</keycap>, you move by 10 times that.
        <keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>&gt;</keycap></keycombo> and
        <keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>&lt;</keycap></keycombo> scale up or down to 200% or
        50% of the original, respectively. Default rotates are by 15 degrees; with
        <keycap function="control">Ctrl</keycap>, you rotate by 90 degrees.
      </para>
      <para>
        However, perhaps the most useful are <firstterm>pixel-size transformations</firstterm>, invoked by using
        <keycap
function="alt">Alt</keycap> with the transform keys. For example,
        <keycombo><keycap function="alt">Alt</keycap><keycap>arrows</keycap></keycombo> will move the selection by 1
        <firstterm>screen pixel</firstterm> (i.e. a pixel on your monitor). This means that if you zoom in, you can move
        objects with very high precision, if you're using <keycap>Alt</keycap> with your keyboard shortcut. In reverse,
        when you zoom out, precision will be lower when you use the <keycap>Alt</keycap> key. Using different zoom
        levels, you can vary the amount of precision that you need for your current task.
      </para>
      <para>
        Similarly, <keycombo><keycap
function="alt">Alt</keycap><keycap>&gt;</keycap></keycombo> and
        <keycombo><keycap function="alt">Alt</keycap><keycap>&lt;</keycap></keycombo> scale the selection so that its
        visible size changes by one screen pixel, and
        <keycombo><keycap function="alt">Alt</keycap><keycap>[</keycap></keycombo> and
        <keycombo><keycap function="alt">Alt</keycap><keycap>]</keycap></keycombo> rotate it so that its
        farthest-from-center point moves by one screen pixel.
      </para>
      <para>
        Note: Linux users may not get the expected results with the
        <keycombo><keycap function="alt">Alt</keycap><keycap>arrow</keycap></keycombo> and a few other key combinations
        if their Window Manager catches those key events before they reach the Inkscape application (and uses it to do
        things like switching workspaces instead). One solution would be to change the Window Manager's configuration
        accordingly.
      </para>

    <sect1>
      <title>Multiple selections</title>
      <para>
        You can select any number of objects simultaneously by
        <keycombo><keycap
function="shift">Shift</keycap><mousebutton
role="click">click</mousebutton></keycombo>ing
        them. Or, you can <mousebutton
role="mouse-drag">drag</mousebutton> around the objects you need to select; this
        is called <firstterm>rubberband selection</firstterm>. (Selector creates rubberband when dragging from an empty
        space; however, if you press <keycap
function="shift">Shift</keycap> before starting to drag, Inkscape will
        always create the rubberband.) Practice by selecting all three of the shapes below:
      </para>
      <informalfigure>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>
      <para>
        Now, use rubberband (by drag or
        <keycombo><keycap
function="shift">Shift</keycap><mousebutton
role="mouse-drag">drag</mousebutton></keycombo>)
        to select the two ellipses but not the rectangle:
      </para>
      <informalfigure>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="basic-f05.svg"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>
      <para>
        Each individual object within a selection displays a <firstterm>selection cue</firstterm> &#8212; by default, a
        dashed rectangular frame. These cues make it easy to see at once what is selected and what is not. For example,
        if you select both the two ellipses and the rectangle, without the cues you would have a hard time guessing
        whether the ellipses are selected or not.
      </para>
      <para>
        <keycombo><keycap function="shift">Shift</keycap><mousebutton
role="click">click</mousebutton></keycombo>ing on
        a selected object excludes it from the selection. Select all three objects above, then use
        <keycombo><keycap
function="shift">Shift</keycap><mousebutton
role="click">click</mousebutton></keycombo> to
        exclude both ellipses from the selection leaving only the rectangle selected.
      </para>
      <para>
        Pressing <keycap>Esc</keycap> deselects all selected objects.
        <keycombo><keycap function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>A</keycap></keycombo> selects all objects in the
        current layer (if you did not create any layers, this is the same as all objects in the document). The default
        behavior of the <keycombo><keycap function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>A</keycap></keycombo> shortcut can be
        adjusted in the preferences.
      </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
      <title>Grouping</title>
      <para>
        Several objects can be combined into a <firstterm>group</firstterm>. A group behaves as a single object when you
        drag or transform it. Below, the three objects on the left are independent; the same three objects on the right
        are grouped. Try to drag the group.
      </para>
      <informalfigure>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="basic-f06.svg"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>
      <para>
        To create a group, select one or more objects and press
        <keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>G</keycap></keycombo>. To ungroup one or more groups,
        select them and press <keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>U</keycap></keycombo>. These
        actions are also accessible by <mousebutton role="right-click">right click</mousebutton>, the
        <guimenu>Object</guimenu> menu, or the Commands bar. Groups themselves may be grouped, just like any other
        objects; such nested groups may go down to arbitrary depth. However,
        <keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>U</keycap></keycombo> only ungroups the topmost level
        of grouping in a selection; you'll need to press
        <keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>U</keycap></keycombo> repeatedly if you want to
        completely ungroup a deep group-in-group (or use
        <menuchoice><guimenu>Extensions</guimenu><guisubmenu>Arrange</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Deep
        Ungroup</guimenuitem></menuchoice>).
      </para>
      <para>
        You don't necessarily have to ungroup, however, if you want to edit an object within a group. Just
        <keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><mousebutton
role="click">click</mousebutton></keycombo> that
        object and it will be selected and editable alone, or
        <keycombo><keycap function="shift">Shift</keycap><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><mousebutton
role="click">click</mousebutton></keycombo>
        several objects (inside or outside any groups) for multiple selection regardless of grouping.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can also <mousebutton role="click">double-click</mousebutton> on a group, to enter it and access all the
        objects inside without ungrouping. <mousebutton role="click">Double-click</mousebutton> on any empty canvas area
        to leave the group again.
      </para>
      <para>
        Try to move or transform the individual shapes in the group (above right) without ungrouping it, then deselect
        and select the group normally to see that it still remains grouped.

      <title>Fill and stroke</title>
      <para>
        Probably the simplest way to paint an object some color is to select an object, and click a
        <firstterm>swatch</firstterm> (color field) in the palette below the canvas to paint it (change its fill color).
      </para>
      <para>
        Alternatively, you can open the Swatches dialog from the <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu (or press
        <keycombo><keycap
function="shift">Shift</keycap><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>W</keycap></keycombo>),
        select the palette that you want to use after clicking on the little triangle in its top right corner, select an
        object, and click any swatch to fill the object (change its fill color).
      </para>
      <para>
        More powerful is the Fill and Stroke dialog from the <guimenu>Object</guimenu> menu (or press
        <keycombo><keycap
function="shift">Shift</keycap><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>F</keycap></keycombo>).
        Select the shape below and open the Fill and Stroke dialog.
      </para>
      <informalfigure>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>
      <para>
        You will see that the dialog has three tabs: Fill, Stroke paint, and Stroke style. The Fill tab lets you edit
        the fill (interior) of the selected object(s). Using the buttons just below the tab, you can select types of
        fill, including no fill (the button with the X), flat color fill, as well as linear or radial gradients. For the
        above shape, the flat fill button will be activated.

      <para>
        Further below, you see a collection of <firstterm>color pickers</firstterm>, each in its own tab: RGB, CMYK,
        HSL, and Wheel. Perhaps the most convenient is the Wheel picker, where you can rotate the triangle to choose a
        hue on the wheel, and then select a shade of that hue within the triangle. All color pickers contain a slider
        labelled “A“ to set the <firstterm>alpha</firstterm> (opacity) of the selected color.
      </para>
      <para>
        Whenever you select an object, the color picker is updated to display its current fill and stroke (for multiple
        selected objects, the dialog shows their <emphasis>average</emphasis> color). Play with these samples or create
        your own:
      </para>
      <informalfigure>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="basic-f08.svg"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>
      <para>
        Using the Stroke paint tab, you can remove the <firstterm>stroke</firstterm> (outline) of the object, or assign
        any color or transparency to it:
      </para>
      <informalfigure>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="basic-f09.svg"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>
      <para>
        The last tab, Stroke style, lets you set the width and other parameters of the stroke:
      </para>
      <informalfigure>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="basic-f10.svg"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>
      <para>
        Finally, instead of a flat color, you can use <firstterm>gradients</firstterm> for fills and/or strokes:
      </para>
      <informalfigure>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="basic-f11.svg"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>
      <para>
        When you switch from flat color to gradient, the newly created gradient uses the previous flat color, going from
        opaque to transparent. Switch to the Gradient tool
        (<keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo> or just <keycap>G</keycap>) to
        drag the <firstterm>gradient handles</firstterm> &#8212; the controls connected by lines that define the
        direction and length of the gradient. When any of the gradient handles is selected (highlighted blue), the Fill
        and Stroke dialog sets (and displays) the color of that handle instead of the color of the entire selected
        object.
      </para>
      <para>
        Yet another convenient way to change the color of an object is by using the Dropper tool (<keycap>F7</keycap> or
        <keycap>D</keycap>). Just <mousebutton
role="click">click</mousebutton> anywhere in the drawing with that tool,
        and the color you clicked on will be assigned to the selected object's fill
        (<keycombo><keycap function="shift">Shift</keycap><mousebutton
role="click">click</mousebutton></keycombo> will
        assign the stroke color).
      </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
      <title>Duplication, alignment, distribution</title>
      <para>
        One of the most common operations is <firstterm>duplicating</firstterm> an object
        (<keycombo><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>D</keycap></keycombo>). The duplicate is placed
        exactly on top of the original and is selected, so you can drag it away by <mousebutton>mouse</mousebutton> or
        by <keycap>arrow</keycap> keys. For practice, try to add copies of this black square in a line next to each
        other:
      </para>
      <informalfigure>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="basic-f12.svg"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>
      <para>
        Chances are, your copies of the square are placed more or less randomly. This is where the
        <menuchoice><guimenu>Object</guimenu><guimenuitem>Align and Distribute</guimenuitem></menuchoice> dialog
        (<keycombo><keycap
function="shift">Shift</keycap><keycap
function="control">Ctrl</keycap><keycap>A</keycap></keycombo>)
        is useful. Select all the squares
        (<keycombo><keycap function="shift">Shift</keycap><mousebutton
role="click">click</mousebutton></keycombo> or
        drag a rubberband), open the dialog and press the “Center on horizontal axis” button, then the “Make
        horizontal gaps between objects equal” button (read the button tooltips). The objects are now neatly aligned
        and distributed with equal spaces in between. Here are some other alignment and distribution examples:

      <title>Z-order</title>
      <para>
        The term <firstterm>z-order</firstterm> refers to the stacking order of objects in a drawing, i.e. to which
        objects are on top of other objects, and cover them, so the bottom objects are not (completely) visible. The two
        commands in the <guimenu>Object</guimenu> menu, <guimenuitem>Raise to Top</guimenuitem> (the
        <keycap>Home</keycap> key) and <guimenuitem>Lower to Bottom</guimenuitem> (the <keycap>End</keycap> key), will
        move your selected objects to the very top or very bottom of the current layer's z-order. Two more commands,
        <guimenuitem>Raise</guimenuitem> (<keycap>PgUp</keycap>) and <guimenuitem>Lower</guimenuitem>
        (<keycap>PgDn</keycap>), will sink or emerge the selection <emphasis>one step only</emphasis>, i.e. move it past
        one non-selected object in z-order (only objects that overlap the selection count, based on their respective
        bounding boxes).
      </para>
      <para>
        Practice using these commands by reversing the z-order of the objects below, so that the leftmost ellipse is on
        top and the rightmost one is at the bottom:
      </para>
      <informalfigure>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="basic-f14.svg"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>
      <para>
        A very useful selection shortcut is the <keycap>Tab</keycap> key. If nothing is selected, it selects the
        bottommost object; otherwise it selects the object <emphasis>above the selected object(s)</emphasis> in z-order.
        <keycombo><keycap function="shift">Shift</keycap><keycap>Tab</keycap></keycombo> works in reverse, starting from
        the topmost object and proceeding downwards. Since the objects you create are added to the top of the stack,
        pressing <keycombo><keycap function="shift">Shift</keycap><keycap>Tab</keycap></keycombo> with nothing selected
        will conveniently select the object you created <emphasis>last</emphasis>. Practice the <keycap>Tab</keycap> and
        <keycombo><keycap function="shift">Shift</keycap><keycap>Tab</keycap></keycombo> keys on the stack of ellipses
        above.

      <title>Selecting under and dragging selected</title>
      <para>
        What to do if the object you need is hidden behind another object? You may still see the bottom object if the
        top one is (partially) transparent, but clicking on it will select the top object, not the one you need.
      </para>
      <para>
        This is what
        <keycombo><keycap function="alt">Alt</keycap><mousebutton
role="click">click</mousebutton></keycombo> is for.
        First <keycombo><keycap
function="alt">Alt</keycap><mousebutton
role="click">click</mousebutton></keycombo>
        selects the top object, just like the regular click. However, the next
        <keycombo><keycap
function="alt">Alt</keycap><mousebutton
role="click">click</mousebutton></keycombo> at the
        same point will select the object <emphasis>below</emphasis> the top one; the next one, the object still lower,
        etc. Thus, several
        <keycombo><keycap
function="alt">Alt</keycap><mousebutton
role="click">click</mousebutton></keycombo>s in a row
        will cycle, top-to-bottom, through the entire z-order stack of objects at the click point. When the bottom
        object is reached, next
        <keycombo><keycap
function="alt">Alt</keycap><mousebutton
role="click">click</mousebutton></keycombo> will,
        naturally, again select the topmost object.
      </para>

        [If you are on Linux, you might find that
        <keycombo><keycap
function="alt">Alt</keycap><mousebutton
role="click">click</mousebutton></keycombo> does not
        work properly. Instead, it might be moving the whole Inkscape window. This is because your window manager has
        reserved <keycombo><keycap function="alt">Alt</keycap><mousebutton
role="click">click</mousebutton></keycombo>
        for a different action. The way to fix this is to find the Window Behavior configuration for your window
        manager, and either turn it off, or map it to use the <keycap>Meta</keycap> key (aka <keycap>Windows</keycap>
        key), so Inkscape and other applications may use the <keycap function="alt">Alt</keycap> key freely.]

      <para>
        This is nice, but once you selected an under-the-surface object, what can you do with it? You can use keys to
        transform it, and you can drag the selection handles. However, dragging the object itself will reset the
        selection to the top object again (this is how click-and-drag is designed to work &#8212; it selects the (top)
        object under the cursor first, then drags the selection). To tell Inkscape to drag <emphasis>what is selected
        now</emphasis>, without selecting anything else, use
        <keycombo><keycap function="alt">Alt</keycap><mousebutton
role="mouse-drag">drag</mousebutton></keycombo>. This
        will move the current selection, no matter where you drag your mouse.

      <title>Selecting similar objects</title>
      <para>
        Inkscape can select other objects that are similar to the object that is currently selected. For example, if you
        want to select all the blue squares below, first select one of the blue squares, and use
        <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guisubmenu>Select Same</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Fill
        Color</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the menu (<mousebutton role="right-click">right-click</mousebutton> on the
        canvas). All objects with the same blue fill color are now selected.
      </para>
      <informalfigure>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>

        </mediaobject>
      </informalfigure>
      <para>
        In addition to selecting by fill color, you can select multiple similar objects by stroke color, stroke style,
        fill &amp; stroke, and object type. If these are not enough choices for your use case, try using the
        <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Find/Replace</guimenuitem></menuchoice> dialog.

        This concludes the Basic tutorial. There's much more than that to Inkscape, but with the techniques described
        here, you will already be able to create simple yet useful graphics. To learn more, we recommend going through
