From https://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace:

The "xml:" Namespace

This Version: 26 October 2009

Description

The namespace whose name is http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace is bound by
definition to the prefix xml: according to Namespaces in XML (and by Namespaces
in XML 1.1). Note that unlike all other XML namespaces, both the name and the
prefix are specified; i.e., if you want XML 1.0 processors to recognize this
namespace, you must use the reserved prefix xml:.
