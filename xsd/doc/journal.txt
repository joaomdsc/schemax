Instead of one class for each element (tag) kind, maybe I could use just two
classes:

- one for inline elements, which require an enclosing paragraph
- one for block elements (outside a paragraph, or that create a paragraph?)

The question is, do I need to know who the parent is? Why do I need to know
whether the <code> element is inside <p>, a <phrase>, or a <termdef>? Maybe a
<code> is a <code>, whatever the parent; or maybe it's enough to distinguish
inline or block.
