** Arguments to the __init__ function

If the code supports derived classes, the arguments to __init__ need to include
(but separate) the arguments that are destined for the superclasses.

generate_init():
----------------
- the function signature has *all* the parameters, super and derived
  - we need to distinguish required vs. optional
- if the class is derived, the __init__ body must start with a call to super's
  __init__, with only the superclass parameters (required before optional)
- the assignments in the body are done only for the class's own parameters

(Using a PyClass instance, it's easy to include the 'derived' information in
the class, and use it in a gen_init() that's a class method)

generate_build()
----------------
This is specific to this project, so that needs be a method of a class that
we'll derive from PyClass

- for implementing the 'build' calls:
  - it needs the list of ancestor classes
  - it needs the parameters (both attr and elems) for each ancestor class
- for extracting  attributes from the XML tree, it needs self's attributes
- for extracting  sub-elements from the XML tree, it needs self's elements

Attributes and sub-elements are precisely what constitute the class that we
derive from PyClass.

generate_dictify()
------------------
This is a standard part of PyClass. Need to distinguish parameters that are
complex types (python classes), as opposed to scalars, and lists of complex
types (python classes), as opposed to lists of scalars. Also need to know if
the class is derived.

generate_attrs(), generate_sub_elems()
--------------------------------------
Derived class, specific to this XML-based project.

Next step: add support for class derivation in PyClass.

gen_init():
  - needs 'derived' information
  - signature:
      - all the required params, self + ancestors
      - all the optional params, self + ancestors
  - call to super().__init__:
      - all the required params, ancestors
      - all the optional params, ancestors
  - body:
      - all the params (req + opt), self only
  - no need to distinguish scalar vs. complex

gen_dictify():
  - needs 'derived' information (whether to call super or not)
  - body:
      - need to distinguish scalars (dictifiable) from complex types
      - need to distinguish list of complex types (as opposed to lists of scalars)
      - need to distinguish dicts of complex types (as opposed to dicts of scalars)
      - no need to distinguish required vs. optional

gen_build():
  - needs 'derived' information, and list of ancestor classes
  - needs all the params for the ancestors (just the names, not req vs. opt, not
    scalar vs. complex)
  - needs self's attributes
  - need self's elements
      - need to distinguish single vs. list, and scalar vs. complex (4 cases)
